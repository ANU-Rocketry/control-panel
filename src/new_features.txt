Rethink sequences:
 New CSV format:
  close eth vent
  wait 15s
  download svg (high res/no decimation)
 store on the server rather than choose file, and edit inline
 remove pin numbers from the control panel pane

Y zoom feature - zoom vertically around cursor when the axis is under the mouse

green light when connected

print statements aren't in the log, only tracebacks
for some reason the logging is only for stderr
make a custom logging library and fix the datalogger code

fix popup cursor not appearing sometimes, mainly at high zoom levels

disable page scroll issue is still present

disable auto abort sequence? dangerous at this point

operation modes

jump to present button is ugly and sometimes appears on the left
graph panel sizing is incorrect

datalogging
* use an append only sqlite database for each session?

the frontend doesn't seem to reconnect if the backend is stopped and restarted

more obvious indicator if the frontend loses network connection

second RPi that isn't on the UPS which we ping to check if the power is still on?
* We want an indicator of whether the power is on on the front-end
* This requires that the pi and all networking equipment is on the UPS
* What happens if the LabJacks lose power but not the pi? Or are they powered by the pi
